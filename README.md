This project aims at simplifying the procedure of car registration for people in Melbourne and easing the vehicle management burden for VicRoads and Traffic Control staffs. To be specific, a car registration/machine learning mobile application which suites both Android and IOS operation systems was developed by our group, and the my individual project task was setting database in the cloud and developing a web application.

1. Functional Requirements
Back-end Function Requirements:
At first, the database should be established in cloud and the cloud service provider can be chosen freely. Also, this database should contain a table “register” to store all relevant information. Most importantly, this database should be able to process all legal SQL queries and respond correctly and quickly.

API Function Requirements: 
An API should be designed and implemented successfully enough to connect all functions of both back-end and front-end. At the same time, this API is required to be effective and efficient during functioning.

Front-end Function Requirements: 
To begin with, a web application which provides two different login functions for car owners and authorized VicRoads officers respectively. 
After login successfully, for car owners, a SQL query will processed automatically and page jumping function will be proved; for authorized VicRoads officers, a retrieval function based on the input account (license plate number) and an editing function in the light of all existing records are required. At last, an automatic page reloading function is realized for retrieval function and editing function.
